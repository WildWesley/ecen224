* Today's Make demonstration is a walkthrough which you can find on the class website under **Recitations**. We encourage you to follow along in the walkthrough or do it on your own to get comfortable with Git and GitHub.
* The C Programming demo will be freeform so if there's something you want me to try, be prepared to call it out!
