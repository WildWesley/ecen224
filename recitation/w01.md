* Recitation sessions will be on Fridays at **Noon** and **3:00pm**. These were the majority preferred times in the student survey. Coincidentally, they match the times we chose for the first week.
* Both sessions will be the same so you only need to attend one or the other (unless you really need a lot of help).
* Also see "Intro to Linux Shell" linked to in `LearningSuite > schedule`.

"A recitation is a presentation by an ... instructor ... that supplements course materials. In recitations that supplement lectures, the leader will often review the lecture, expand on the concepts, and carry on a discussion with the students.<br/>... Scientific classes, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, often employ the use of recitation sections to help students clarify subject matter that was either not fully understood or inadequately addressed in the limited time of lecture. These recitation sections may be conducted by the professor or a student teaching assistant. These sections provide students with an opportunity to receive additional instruction on confusing subject matter or receive personal assistance with problems or questions assigned as homework in the lecture section"<br/>- Wikipedia
